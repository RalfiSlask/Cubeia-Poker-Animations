## Challenge Description

This an extra code challenge from Cubeia to create poker animations on a limited amount of time. Focus is more on the animations rather then the coding part. 

## Features

- **Poker Avatar**: Poker Avatar placeholder. 
- **Text Animations**: Different text animations with gsap, lottie, framer-motion and videos.
- **Animations**: Animations with videos, gsap and lotte-files.

## Thoughts

Did not want the animations to be to crazy so i chose to have more focus on the text rather than its surrounding elements. Can do a lot more in after effects in the future if necessary, also the colors could be more optimatized for the poker sites.

### Future Improvments 

- Refactor code / smaller components
- Lazy loading
- Improve Animations even more
